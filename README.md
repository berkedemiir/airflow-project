# airflow-project
This project demonstrates the transfer of data between two PostgreSQL databases using Python and Docker, and automating this process with Apache Airflow. Initially, the environment is set up by creating a virtual environment and installing necessary packages. Airflow is then configured and initialized. Docker containers are used to manage PostgreSQL databases, and a Python script is implemented to handle the data transfer. The script is integrated into an Airflow DAG to schedule and automate the process. Finally, Airflow connections are configured to link to the PostgreSQL databases, and the data transfer DAG is executed through the Airflow web interface, showcasing a seamless data pipeline solution.
